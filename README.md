Programming Languages

Within my final project the problem that needed to be solved was to create an application that took in user input and read a seperate file and itterate through it to get a certain output. I think that I did well with the display menu and getting input from the user. I believe I used the most effiecent code I could for this.
I think I could enhance my caode with using exceptions to be able to validate the user input more efficiently. I found that writing code to call to the python file and being able to incorporate that into my cpp file was extremly challenging. I used the zybook and at times used stackoverflow to see how I could approach issues I was running into and try new things. 
CPP is a valuable language to learn that will be applicable to more classes. Furthermore, being able to use multiple different types of code in an application is an important tool to have.
I made it maintainable by creating multiple files anmd classes that called to othger classes and functions. Making a program object oriented makes it easier to maintain and cgange later on if needed.
